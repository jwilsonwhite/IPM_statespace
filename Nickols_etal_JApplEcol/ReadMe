This is the data and code described in Nickols et al., Journal of Applied Ecology (2019) Setting ecological expectations 
for adaptive management of marine protected areas. These codes build off of data and code presented in White et al., Ecological 
Applications (2016) Fitting state-space integral projection models to time series data. All code is written in Matlab. 

Found in IPM_statespace from White et al. 2016:
The original PISCO data (for selected species and sites) in in directory PISCO_data_2015. 
The fits to those data are in runs_for_publication_pre2007_July2015. IPM_parameters.m gives the parameters for the model runs.  

Specific to Nickols et al. 2019: 
runme_IPMfrwd.m is the driver file for reading in PISCO monitoring data (read_PISCOdata.m), finding the stable size distribution 
(SSD: findSSD.m), running the IPM forward from the SSD under fishing and fishing scenarios with constant and random recruitment 
(rockfish_frwdproject_SSD), and running the IPM forward from the initial size distribution at the time of MPA implementation 
(rockfish_frwdproject). 

ROC_Curves_SMYS.m computes ROC curves for each site for output from rockfish_frwdproject_SSD.m and rockfish_frwdproject.m, calls 
ROC.m

Read_PISCOdata_zone2.m and IPM_histo_per_zone2.m are used to calculate data points with error bars for reference and MPA sites 
in Figure 3 in Nickols et al. 2019. During each sampling event at a site, fish are counted along transects divided into sites, 
sides, zones, and transects. We computed means per zone and their associated standard deviation. See piscoweb.org for information 
on how monitoring sites are sampled. zone_error.m and zone_error_ref.m use IPM_histo_per_zone2.m to provide the means and errors bars 
for the figure.
