ReadMe for Channel Islands, CA, application of the state-space IPM

This code was used in the analysis documented in 
White JW, Yamane MT, Nickols KJ, Caselle JE
"Analysis of fish population size structures confirms cessation of fishing in marine protected areas"

primary author: will.white@oregonstate.edu
language: Matlab

File descriptions:

runme_IPM.m 
Main script that calls all of the other files necessary to fit the model for a particular site and species

IPM_parameters_ChannelIslands.m
File with life history parameters for each fish species and settings for the SSIPM implementation

read_PISCOdta_ChannelIslands.m
Reads in the data in data/UCSB_to2017_noHeaders.csv and formats for use in the model

The runme_IPM.m script calls a number of helper files also found in IPM_statespace from White et al. 2016:
do_IPM.m (to run the IPM)
kernmatSimp.m (generates the mesh kernel for IPM integration)
mkkern.m (makes the IPM kernel)
makeSimpVec (to make the Simpson vector for integration)
rockfish_fit_pisco.m (fits the IPM to data using MCMC; calls do_IPM.m)
IPM_histo (to convert count data into histogram)
onto_ogive.m (creates data observation ogive for blue rockfish)

postproc_pisco_rockfish_fit.m
Performs post-processing on the MCMC chains.
Also produces plots of fits of the model to data (like Fig S1 in the manuscript)

plot_posterior_distributions.m
Calls postproc_pisco_rockfish_fit.m to generate model-fit figures for each site/species combination

plot_ChannelIslands_posteriors.m
Generates Fig 2 in the ms, showing posterior distributions of F for each site/species

human_name.m
Converts PISCO codes into human-friendlier strings for plotting purposes
